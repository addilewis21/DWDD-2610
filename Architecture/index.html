                <p>The professor came around and he was looking at our like things and it was sitting and it like clearly looks 
                    like a tooth. Have I showed you it? Yeah. And it so clearly looks like a tooth and it was sitting like with 
                    the base on the bottom so I could carve it easier. He came around and he was like, this shape is a little 
                    boring for my taste but it's fine. And I was like okay, and he was like how do you want to display it. </p>
                    <p>What? What did he think it was? I don't know, I literally think he thought it was supposed to be like this 
                    with like 2 prongs going up. Which obviously is boring. I was like no I'm thinking about displaying it this 
                    way like a tooth. And he was like that's so, I like that a lot more. What did other people do? A lot, 
                    nobody elses really looked like something. Like it's kind of just supposed to be like abstract. But yours 
                    was boring? Well it was just boring when he thought it was like two nubs.</p>
