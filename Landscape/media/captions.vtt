00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.980
The professor came around and he was&nbsp;
looking at our like things and it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.220
sitting and it like clearly looks&nbsp;
like a tooth. Have I showed you it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.340
Yeah. And it so clearly looks like a tooth and it&nbsp;
was sitting like with the base on the bottom so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.560
could carve it easier. He came around and he was&nbsp;
like, this shape is a little boring for my taste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.920
but it's fine. And I was like okay, and he was&nbsp;
like how do you want to display it. What? What did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
he think it was? I don't know, I literally think&nbsp;
he thought it was supposed to be like this with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.060
like 2 prongs going up. Which obviously is boring.&nbsp;
I was like no I'm thinking about displaying it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:43.080
this way like a tooth. And he was like that's so,&nbsp;
I like that a lot more. What did other people do?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
A lot, nobody elses really looked like&nbsp;
something. Like it's kind of just supposed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
like abstract. But yours was boring? Well it was&nbsp;
just boring when he thought it was like two nubs.
