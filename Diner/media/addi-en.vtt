00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
stand up the professor came around and

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.080
he was looking at our like things and it

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.780
was sitting it like clearly looks like a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.000
tooth have I showed you it

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.920
like soakly looks like a tooth and it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
was sitting with the base on the bottom

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.160
so I could carve it easier he came

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.560
around he's like

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.500
two ships a little boring for my taste

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.760
but it's fine and I was like okay and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.039
he's like how would you how do you want

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
to display it and I was like what did he

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.099
think it was I don't know I literally

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.199
think he thought it was supposed to be

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.620
like this would like two prongs going up

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.540
which obviously is boring I was like no

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.780
I'm thinking about displaying it this

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.300
way like a tooth and he was just like

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.680
that's so I like that a lot more what

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
did other people do

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
a lot nobody else's looks like something

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.219
like it's kind of just supposed to be

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.899
like but yeah

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.980
well it was boring when you just thought

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.980
it was like two Nubs
